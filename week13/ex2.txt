Prevention:
Designing the program to have no deadlocks which is extremely difficult to achieve but offers the bets performance.

Recovery:
Works to solve an existing deadlock. Is not stable.

Avoidance:
The safest strategy, fairly easy to implement but does not offer the best performance because it attempts to predict the deadlock ahead of time.
