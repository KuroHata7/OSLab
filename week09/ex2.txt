-Repeating page numbers in sequence will result in an increased hit/miss rate. For example: [10, 10, 10, 7, 7, 7, 1, 1, 1]
-Repeating page numbers less frequently will result in a decreased hit/miss rate. 
And having each number occur only once will result in a null hit/miss rate: For example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
